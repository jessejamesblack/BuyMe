        [*] view the list of "similar" items on auctions in the preceding month (and auction information about them). [This is helpful for people posting things to sell, in order to figure out what are reasonable minimum prices.]
 

 Everywhere above where there is a function for creating something, one
should/could have ones for modifying and deleting it; these are not listed,
in order to make the description shorter.  But this is an opportunity for
"staged development": enhance your system (and grade :) as time allows at
the end by adding these features.)
